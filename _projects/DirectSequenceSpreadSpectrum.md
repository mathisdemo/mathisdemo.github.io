This project investigates spread spectrum transmission using a direct sequence spreading technique. Performance evaluation is first conducted over a Gaussian channel, with the possible presence of a jammer. Then, an experimental transmission over an acoustic channel is performed. The entire study is carried out in the Jupyter Notebook environment.

## 🎯 Purpose

- 🌌 **Spread Spectrum Transmission**: Analyze direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) techniques.
- 📊 **Performance Evaluation**: Assess system performance under Gaussian noise and jamming conditions.
- 🔊 **Acoustic Channel Experimentation**: Implement DSSS transmission over an acoustic medium.
- 🖥️ **Jupyter Notebook Implementation**: Develop and document the study in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
